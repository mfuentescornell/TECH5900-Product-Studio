# Experiment Two

## Risk
Stale data may be less valuable for customers, therefore we need to assess the risk of users not updating their data frequently enough on the platform.

## Experiment Description
Determining whether or not patients and/or data partners are willing to update healthcare data on the marketplace on a regular cadence. This is important because if data is rarely updated on the marketplace, the marketplace would quickly become useless and organizations would stop using the platform, leading to the platform's demise. 

We would like to check the engagement rate of the stakeholders on how likely they are willing to update their data on our platform. To evaluate this risk, we will conduct an experiment through sending a text message to our target.

This experiment would require the participation of patients and partners as the key element of our product. We will ask patients/individuals to participate in a study for our prototype to test their engagement with our product and see whether they are willing to update their healthcare data regularly under three conditions:
(1) without reminders (once a week)
(2) with infrequent reminders (three times a week)
(3) with frequent reminders (daily)

Some of the tools we would use in order to set up this experiment would include but would not be limited to:
(1) QR codes in bulletin boards at hospitals / urgent care centers / etc.
(2) Advertisements on Facebook
(3)  Automated text messaging to notify users (https://github.com/nevoit/Automated-Messages/blob/master/whatsapp/whatsapp.py)
