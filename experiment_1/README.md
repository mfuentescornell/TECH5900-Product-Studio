# Experiment One

## Risk
One of the primary assumptions we made with HealthifyYou is that people with rare diseases are more likely to share their health data than other people sharing other, “regular” health data. Health data (irrespective of whether it is rare diseases or regular health data) consists of sensitive/private information among personal data such as name, zip code etc. which people understandably would be apprehensive about sharing. 

## Experiment Description
Posting survey links on Facebook; more specifically in two groups that are one, centered around rare diseases and the other on a randomly selected group on general health and fitness (e.g. people recovering from bone fractures). The experiment will involve a treatment and control, treatment group would measure how willing people with rare diseases are willing to share their health data which often involves personal/private data compared to the other group.
